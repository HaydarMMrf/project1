              <h1>What is a software </h1>
              <p>Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the compute r how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work . In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media</p>

              <h2>Types of software</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Application software</li>
                  <li>System software</li>
                  <li>Malicious software or malware</li>

              <h2>Operating systems</h2>
              <p>which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs "on top" of them. Supervisory programs, boot loaders, shells and window systems are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system</p>

              <h2>Device drivers</h2>
              <p>which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.</p>

              <h2>Utilities</h2>
              <p>which are computer programs designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.</p>
